UPDATE WORDS (this is simple enough)

ADD WAY TO RENAME CATEGORIES ASAP
    * option 1: add enabled/disabled setting to all categories, disable old name, enable new name
    * option 2: add name map (map old name to new name separately, drop old, create new)
    * option 3: both of above?
Add a way to change *latest* version without restarting the service
Add a way to get number of currently connected clients

Fix lost matchmaking state:
    * Games should try to add themselves when they're activated
    * adding second player to games should fail gracefully for games with two existing players

Video ads
back button twice -> two open menus bug

Disconnect idle clients
The bloody keyboard!

CLIENT Show pending answer
CLIENT Rewarded video ad
CLIENT Interesting/Uninteresting data per player to disallow duplicated voting -> store on client, too much work yielding too little value for server

BUGS

*************************************************
Optional / for later
*************************************************

SERVER Two clients connecting with same ID causes the server to keep disconnecting them in favor of each other, one of them should back down

SERVER Separate game history? There's a bit of performance and some complexity to gain from adding a separate "GameHistoryRecord" grain
SERVER planned down-time -> notify players in some way (broadcast messages?) (Use push notifications for now?)
SERVER Global notification: Notify those already in the game via broadcast message (implement that too!), notify those that log in on startup
SERVER Safe service restart -> 
    Notify status service (how?)
    ***stop timing games*** (?)
    reject new connections
    turn service off when no connections remain -> **might take a lot of time**! Force people out after a while?

SERVER Embed the password recovery website into the silo host ->
    Move website projects out of their folder structure and unify with rest of solution
    Move entire solution into an src directory
    Remove the website specific FAKE script and create a top-level FAKE script to handle everything (service status included)
    Turn Saturn.Application.run into a hosted service

SERVER split needed grains into separate assembly to prevent builds of service status and password recovery depending on almost everything

CLIENT notify game expiry with a popup
CLIENT Keep keyboard open while in game screen
CLIENT Make generation of build information file automatic
CLIENT XP/Score/Gold/Rank change notifications after game is complete
CLIENT Clear game history button
