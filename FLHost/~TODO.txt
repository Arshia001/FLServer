SERVER Separate game history? There's a bit of performance and some complexity to gain from adding a separate "GameHistoryRecord" grain
SERVER planned down-time -> notify players in some way (broadcast messages?) (Use push notifications for now?)
SERVER Global notification: Notify those already in the game via broadcast message (implement that too!), notify those that log in on startup
SERVER Safe service restart -> 
	Notify status service (how?)
	***stop timing games*** (?)
	reject new connections
	turn service off when no connections remain -> **might take a lot of time**! Force people out after a while?

SERVER Embed the password recovery website into the silo host ->
	Move website projects out of their folder structure and unify with rest of solution
	Move entire solution into an src directory
	Remove the website specific FAKE script and create a top-level FAKE script to handle everything (service status included)
	Turn Saturn.Application.run into a hosted service

CLIENT notify game expiry with a popup
